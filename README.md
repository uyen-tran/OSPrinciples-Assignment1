Processes can communicate either using shared memory or message passing. In this question you will use POSIX shared memory for a sorting problem. Implement C/C++ programs that follow the following instructions: 
 
- First process will create a shared memory of size 2048. It will generate 10 random numbers ranging from 1-1000 and write those numbers to the shared memory. 

- Second process will read numbers from the shared memory sort them in an ascending order and print them. 

- Third process will read numbers from the shared memory sort them in a descending order, print them and remove the shared memory. 

- Create makefile to compile the three programs. 

- Submit the three programs ( .c/.cpp files), a read me files and the makefile.
